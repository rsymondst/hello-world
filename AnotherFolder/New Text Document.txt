I wrote this text in the GitHub text editor.  The text will be made, initially in the archive on GitHub.

This line was written on my PC.  I had pulled the line above from the archiv on GitHub using the 'git pull origin' command.
The question remains as just how to push these changes back up to the archive.  

Is it easiest to use the Git GUI to stage the changes and then commit and push to the online archive?
